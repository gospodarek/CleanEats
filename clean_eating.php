					<h1>What is clean eating, anyway?</h1>
					<p>I was introduced to "clean eating" only about a year ago. After spending countless hours browsing the internet for healthy eating sites, I came across Tosca Reno's "Eat-Clean-Diet". The more I read, the more it all just seemed right to me. Instead of a diet that focuses on eliminating whole food groups, clean eating encourages a lifestyle change to include removing that which is bad for your body and replacing it with that which is beneficial.</p>
					<p>To me, eating clean is getting back to the <span class="pullquote">foods nature had intended us to eat</span> - veggies, grains, legumes, fruits. It means eating whole foods in their natural state and not foods that have been processed, enhanced or altered in an artificial way.</p>
					<p>I have since read and researched a lot on this topic and I read somewhere once that one should only shop the perimeter of grocery stores as this is generally where fresh ingredients are located. This has always resonated with me and I believe it to be true.</p>
					<p>My husband and I then joined a CSA - <span class="pullquote right">Community Shared Agriculture</span>. This is filler. Blah blah. filleralkdsfj a;lk jjfasdlkfj ;lkaj f;alkdfj ;lkj a;lkdjf a;sldkj /. Here is a photo of our first delivery:</p>
